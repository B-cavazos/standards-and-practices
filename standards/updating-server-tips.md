# Tips for updating and uploading client servers.

## Tip #1 - Pair Programming

- When updating a client's server it is always beneficial to have someone watch you while you upload or update a server.

-- Purpose: Due to someone watching you, many accidents are averted. Some accidents that can be averted are: unwanted files being uploaded, uploading incorrect branch, uploading unfinished work, uploading a database that is behind.

## Tip #2 - Double and Tripple check where you are uploading

- When updating a server, you should always make sure you are updating the correct server.

-- Purpose: Not doing this can result in accidentally uploading to the wrong server.

## Tip # 3 - Uploading and Updating at times when you expect less traffic

- Uploading or updating a server when you expect less traffic can be extremely helpful in situations where a problem occurs.
